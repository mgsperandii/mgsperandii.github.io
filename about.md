I’m a young vegetation scientist with a strong focus on temporal ecology, currently working as a post-doc at the CIDE-CSIC in Francesco de Bello’s lab. My research interests mostly center on analyzing temporal dynamics and understanding the mechanisms regulating the stability of plant communities. I am passionate about collecting and analyzing field data (especially in coastal dunes and dry grasslands), but I am also enthusiast about inspecting large datasets coming from a variety of systems to look for general ecological patterns. 

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
