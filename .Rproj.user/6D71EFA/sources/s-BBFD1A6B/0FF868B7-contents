<p align="justify">I am a  vegetation scientist with a strong focus on temporal ecology. After obtaining my Ph.D at [Roma Tre University](https://scienze.uniroma3.it) (where I was supervised by Prof. [A.T.R. Acosta](http://www.gasbarro.eu/ricercatore1en.html)), I am currently working as a post-doc at the the [Desertification Research Centre](https://www.csic.es/en/investigacion/institutos-centros-y-unidades/desertification-research-centre) in Francesco de Belloâ€™s lab. My research interests mostly center on analyzing temporal dynamics and understanding the mechanisms regulating the stability of plant communities. I am passionate about collecting and analyzing field data (especially in coastal dunes and dry grasslands), but I am also enthusiast about inspecting large datasets coming from a variety of systems to look for general ecological patterns. </p>


<p>I love dogs, horses, baking and taking pictures</p>

<p>Here is a picture of me in the Basque country, one of my fav places</p>
